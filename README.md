# Weather Markets
This repository contains scripts and computations designed to resolve weather markets on the several platforms. It 
includes data processing and analysis tools for markets on various platforms, such as TrueMarkets.
For the purpose of resolving markets, the resolvers retrieve WeatherXM station data from IPFS, perform the 
data filtering, apply cryptographic proof validation and calculate the result based on the needs of each market.

## Features
- H3 grid calculations for geospatial data
- Processing and filtering of large datasets that originate to IPFS
- Functions to compute and validate metrics for markets

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the experiment you wish.
3. Setup properly the required env variables
4. Run the experiment: `docker-compose up`

## Usage
Run the main script with your desired parameters to initiate computations.

For more details, refer to the documentation within the repository.
